### This is a test website I created to mess around HTML and CSS
- The logo and company name used are original and made by me.
- Background images are screenshots from the game Stellaris.
- Code is messy and unoptimized because it was not finished and was my first front-end web project.
> Tools used include VSCode, Photoshop, Premiere and Handbrake.

### This was the ideal finished product(except for contacts page) 
> Current version is pretty close to the one below except for two missing pages and improvements listed in notes.txt.
