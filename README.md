### Single repository for demos to declutter my repositories page.
- Demos are classified as:
  - First time using a language/technology and implementing their basic uses.
  - Precursors to full projects to test the waters.
- Also includes:
  - Codes written for lab exercises/exams in my professional courses that I find interesting.
